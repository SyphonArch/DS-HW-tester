# DS-HW-tester 0.3.0
### Python script to run automated tests on the homework tasks of the Data Structure lecture(2020, 001).

Works with all 6 homework projects of the semester!  
DS-HW-tester was built for your convenience.  
It has formatted output, intelligent testcase parsing, and practical debugging info to speed up your programming.

The default testsets are the official ones, having been downloaded from ETL, with the following exception:  

>A file named '.txt' was found under the '/3-StackCalculator/testset/output/'.
>
>It was ignored in the parsing of the testsets as it did not match the input format for that project.

Homeworks 1-5 are checked by comparing the output to the official testcases.

Homework 6 has a special judge which actively checks your answer to validate it.
## Prerequisites
* Have Python 3 installed (3.6 or above)
* Have `java` in PATH
* Have homework compiled to `.class` Java bytecode

## How to use the tester
1. Clone the repository to your environment of choice.
2. Place your compiled `.class` files of your homework task into the `./source` directory.
3. Run `checker.py` with Python 3.

   You must be CDed into the root directory of this repo.
   
   When running the tester, you may provide the homework number as an argument like below:
   
   `python3 checker.py 1`
   
   If not provided as an argument, you will be prompted upon the execution.
4. That's it! Output that doesn't match will be stored under `./results`.

   For subtle differences you may find the `diff` command useful.

## Customization
You may edit the settings in the `setup.py` file to change program behaviour.

One change you might try is settings the `verbose` flag to `False`.

## Adding custom testcases
1. You add your test input files to `./testcases/{PROJECT_NAME}/testset/input/`
1. You add your expected output files to `./testcases/{PROJECT_NAME}/testset/output/`
3. That's it! You can now run the tester. It will load new testcases automatically.

   Just make sure that your files end with a `.txt` extension.
   
#### Using testcase_gen scripts to generate custom testcases
You may run the scripts under `./testcase_gen` to generate randomized custom testcases and have them placed in their adequate folders.

Note: You must run them after CDing into `./testcase_gen`.



## Platforms
This tester was tested on **macOS Catalina** and **Windows 10**. + And now on **Ubuntu 18.04**. + **Ubuntu 20.04**.

If it doesn't work on your machine, too bad. It worked on my machine. lolz.

## Changelog
* Version 0.1.2: Added input/expected output to results dumping, changed testcase ordering
* Version 0.1.3: Added test timer, results dumping moved to after testing
* Version 0.1.4: Added support for relative path inputs in HW 5, and changed verbose output
* Version 0.1.5: Fixed bug concerning arguments for HW 6, by removing newline char from argument string


* Version 0.2.0: Added custom testcase generator for HW 1
* Version 0.2.1: Stronger custom testcases for HW 1 (contribution of @CookieHCL), as well as stderr handling
* Version 0.2.2: Added stderr output dumping (again from @CookieHCL)
* Version 0.2.3: Added `checker.py` as the new 'standard' way of execution. For compatibility, running `tester.py` still works.
* Version 0.2.4: Added longest single testcase execution time output.


* Version 0.3.0: HW 6 now has active path checking! Your answer will not be compared with a fixed answer; it will be checked based on whether 1. the path is valid, and 2. the path is the shortest.


## Important sidenote
This tester is just a tester.  
i.e., Passing all testcases on this tester does not guarantee that your program will pass the 'official' testing.  
Please use only as a testing tool and reference for debugging.

Thanks!

## Future update plans
Custom testcases and/or custom testcase generator
